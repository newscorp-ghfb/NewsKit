## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behaviour
to james.spencer@news.co.uk.


## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://www.newskit.co.uk/).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/newscorp-ghfb/NewsKit/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/newscorp-ghfb/NewsKit/issues/new/choose) if it is clear what the issue is; otherwise create a new [Discussion](https://github.com/newscorp-ghfb/NewsKit/discussions).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provid the name of your team/title.
- Provide the browser versions used.
- If you can provide a link to your site, or a code sandbox, to demonstrate the issue, then that is a big help. Here is a [newskit template for code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/newskit-v6-template-v4cov2).

We will then investigate the issue and get back to you.

### Reporting Bugs


#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://www.newskit.co.uk/). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/newscorp-ghfb/NewsKit/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search News UK Slack to see if other teams have reported similar issues
- Collect information about the bug:
- Console errors or stack trace
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM) you are using
- Type and version of the browser
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? Does it affect all browsers?


#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to james.spencer@news.co.uk.


We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/newscorp-ghfb/NewsKit/issues/new/choose). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will triage and label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags, and the issue will be analysed, estimated and then implemented.




### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for CONTRIBUTING.md, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.


#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://www.newskit.co.uk/) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, adding the component to your team's library might be better.


#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/newscorp-ghfb/NewsKit/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots/recordings/animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. 
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most CONTRIBUTING.md users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.



### Your First Code Contribution

- Look out for issues labelled "Good First Issue" as these have been pre-approved by the project team and represent an opportunity to increase your contribution experience.
- Read through the `Pre-requisites`, `Getting Started` and `Styleguides` sections in the [README](/README.md).

### Improving The Documentation

- There is always scope for adding team-specific examples to [Storybook](https://storybook.newskit.co.uk/) or the Next.js-based [docs site](https://www.newskit.co.uk/), to help your team members see how to apply NewsKit in your projects. Remember that the Storybook Theme Dropdown can be used to better preview how the components will look on your site.

### Opening a Pull Request

Before making any changes, make sure you have permission to push to the NewsKit repository. You will need to request access to [this group](https://github.com/orgs/newscorp-ghfb/teams/newskit-contributors/members) to become a contributor.

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill in the sections on the PR template and label it as "Ready to Review" when you have completed all changes. This helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Once you submit your PR, a project team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Merging a Pull Request and Releasing it

Merging to `main` branch and releasing will need to be done by a member of the project team. Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible, as NewsKit is open source. You will not be able to use the change in your team's project until a NewsKit release has taken place though. Let the project team know how soon you need the change; otherwise you may be waiting 1-14 days for a routine release to take place.

## The Project Team

The NewsKit core team is a Scrum-sized team based in London and Sofia and includes designers and engineers. Keep an eye on the #newskit channel in Slack for announcements about new versions. Questions can be asked on that channel or one of the team-specific support channels.
