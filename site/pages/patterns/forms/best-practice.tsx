              If you have a lot of information to collect, it’s worth
              considering breaking the form into sensible steps e.g. personal
              details, billing etc. This may reduce cognitive load for users so
              they can focus on one type of data at a time. This also allows for
              customer data, such as email addresses, to be captured early in
              the process, meaning they can contact users who drop out of the
              registration process.
              <br />
              <br />
              It’s always advisable to test each layout with your users and,
              ideally, run experiments to understand which structure has the
              best conversion.

              It has become more common to use ‘float labels’ whereby the Label
              sits within the text field initially and then moves above the Text
              Field once the Text Field becomes in focus. Whilst this is an
              interesting way of displaying Labels, before implementing, you
              should consider if there is any benefit to the user. It uses up
              space for hint text within the field, distracts the user and
              offers little benefit in terms of spacing as space needs to be
              given for the Label above the field either way.

                    Labeling call to actions effectively and contextually means
                    that users understand the action they are taking or where
                    they will be taken on selection of the CTA. (See example, if
                    the user is midway through several steps, ‘Continue’ should
                    be used rather than ‘Submit’ which feels like the end of a

              <br />
              However, avoid multiple submit buttons on forms whenever possible.
              If the form must have multiple submit buttons the primary action
              should come first (i.e: Primary: Continue/Submit, Secondary:

              There might be some cases where a support/help action is needed,
              it should be put as a tertiary action with a link button styling.
              <br />
              <br />
              On mobile, buttons should be centered and go full width, the

              Security when capturing user data is imperative, however you still
              need to consider the user’s experience. CAPTCHA is a commonly used
              security feature whereby users have to enter text that’s displayed
              on screen or select required images to prove that they are not a
              robot.
              <br />
              <br />
              However there are simpler, more user friendly options that don’t
              disrupt the user experience as much and potentially lead to drop
              off. reCAPTCHA is a simpler form of security whereby a user just
              has to select a check box next to ‘I am not a robot’. This is much
              less disruptive to their experience so it is recommended.
