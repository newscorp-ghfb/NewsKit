# Getting Started with NewsKit

## Introduction

NewsKit is a design system created by News UK. Its purpose is
to provide the foundations, components, and templates upon which
you can build your own pages.

## Get started with theming

NewsKit offers you the ability to theme all components. To get started with theming, see: [creating a theme](/theming/creating-a-theme).

## Get started for web

### Pre-requisites

To get started developing with NewsKit, you will have to install the following as pre-requisites:

- You will need an existing **react application** or you can use [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) to create a new one.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) Version 10.\*. If you are using an older version of Node, it is recommended to install other versions via [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) to install the project dependencies.

_Note: We recommend using typescript, but NewsKit will work with vanilla javascript too._

### Installing

NewsKit is available as NPM package, downloadable from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newskit).
To install, simply add NewsKit to your dependencies by calling `yarn add newskit` in the terminal on the root of your project.

### Using

Once you have added `newskit` to your project you can simply
add components to your react pages by importing them from `newskit`
like in the following example:

<CodeFromFile path="examples/guides/get-started-newskit.tsx" />

So here is what is happening in this example:

- The [ThemeProvider](/theming/code) allows the user to provide a theme that is passed to all NewsKit components nested inside it.
- For this example, we are using one of the default themes distributed with NewsKit - `theSunTheme`.
- [Tag](/components/tag) is one of the components exported by NewsKit. In the example, the Tag component receieves two arguments:
  - `href` - which is the URL where the tag will lead us to
  - `size` - The supported sizes for the tag component are placed inside the `TagSize` enum object.

As a result of all this you should see this component inside your page:

<ExampleComponent />

### Bundling

When using any javascript bundler to ship the application to production, it is vital that you should minimize the amount of javascript file size.
This applies to every npm package that you use, not just with newskit, and one way to do this is by removing any unused code in the application bundle.
This is known as [treeskaing](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/), and newskit supports this out of the box.
However, you need to ensure that this is optimisation is enabled in the bundle configuration.
For example for using this with webpack, you need to specify `module` resolve [mainFields](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvemainfields).
