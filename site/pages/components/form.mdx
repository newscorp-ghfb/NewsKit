# Form

## Overview

The Form component is used for processing form data; it's based on [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)

## Usage

The Form component is used by wrapping around form fields, such as the Email Input and Text Input. On submission, it passes the form data to the provided callback function.
The inputs don't need to be direct children of the Form component and can be nested inside other elements.
A submit button is required to be passed to the Form component, and the name property is required on the input.

On form submission, if there are validation errors present, the `onSubmitInvalid` callback function is called with the validation errors. Note that the `onSubmit` callback will not be called when there are validation errors.

<CodeFromFile path="examples/form/invalid-form.tsx" />

## Validation

The Form component handles validation. This only works with the Email Input and Text Input. The validation rules need to be passed to the TextInput. For more information about the validation rules:
[React Hook Form, apply validation](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started/#Applyvalidation) and [React Hook Form, register](https://react-hook-form.com/api/#register)

<CodeFromFile path="examples/form/validated-form.tsx" />

The Form component also supports schema validation. To use an external validation library, for example `Yup`, you can pass `yupResolver(schema)` to the resolver prop. For more information about schema validation with React Hook Form:
[React Hook Form, schema validation](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started/#SchemaValidation)

## Props

<LegacyBlock marginTop="sizing040">
  <Prop name="children" type="Exclude<React.ReactNode, 'undefined'>" required>
    The form requires to have at least a TextInput or EmailInput and a submit
    button.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="onSubmit" type="SubmitHandler" required>
    Function called when form is submitted without validation errors. The data
    parameter consists of an object where the input field names are associated
    with the input values. For more information about the type 'SubmitHandler',
    please visit &nbsp;
    <a href="https://react-hook-form.com/ts#SubmitHandler">
      React Hook Form's documentation
    </a>

    When submitting the form clicking on a button, is suggested to keep the whole logic in the `onSubmit` event
    rather than split it in both an onClick and onSubmit event, for avoiding issues at runtime.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="onSubmitInvalid" type="SubmitErrorHandler">
    Similar to onSubmit, this function is called when submission is attempted
    but fails with validation errors. It receives an object of form element
    names as keys, with FormError objects as values. FormError objects consist
    of the type and message of the error, along with a ref to the offending form
    field element. Type "SubmitErrorHandler" is similar to type "SubmitHandler"
    except that it accepts the errors parameter rather than data.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="validationMode" type="onSubmit | onValidation" default="onSubmit">
    This option allows you to configure when input fields getting validated.
    Currently 'onSubmit' and 'onBlur' are supported.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="reValidationMode" type="onSubmit | onValidation" default="onBlur">
    This option allows you to configure when input fields getting revalidated.
    Currently 'onSubmit' and 'onBlur' are supported.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="defaultValues" type="Record<string, string>">
    The defaultValue for an input is used as the initial value when a component
    is first rendered, before a user interacts with it. The defaultValues object
    uses the form element names as keys.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="resolver" type="Resolver<Record<string, string>, object>">
    The resolver will validate your input data against the schema and return
    with either errors or a valid result.
  </Prop>
</LegacyBlock>
