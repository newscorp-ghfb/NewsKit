# Consent

## Overview

The consent component is a non-visual component for the consent of the use of 3rd party cookies. It triggers the loading of a Sourcepoint CMP (Content Management Platform) dialog to allow the user to decide what 3rd party cookies they wish to allow or disallow on their browser.
Unless you are utilising React Helmet, it must be placed inside the body of the document during server-side rendering.

At the moment this component is supporting three versions of the Sourcepoint config. Versions GDPR TCF V2 and GDPR Non-TCF, these are both legacy implementations (SourcePoint clients implemented before May 5th, 2021 will used these and should be migrated to the Unified Script). 
The most upto date version is the Unified Script.
In addition to GDPR and CCPP the Unified Script has been updated to support MSPA as well.

## Prerequisites

To utilise this component you will need to have a [Sourcepoint](https://www.sourcepoint.com) account and, if required, a Sourcepoint messaging subdomain set up. For more detailed information
please see Sourcepoint [Unified Script or Web Implementation](https://docs.sourcepoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405412395667-CMP-web-implementation). For legacy implementations [documentation TCF V2](https://documentation.sourcepoint.com/web-implementation/web-implementation/sourcepoint-gdpr-and-tcf-v2-support/) or
[documentation Non-TCF](https://documentation.sourcepoint.com/web-implementation/web-implementation/gdpr-non-tcf-web-implementation).

    for a full reference.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In order to add Sourcepoint script for GDPR or CCPA you must add at least an empty gdpr or ccpa object (see below).
    To enable default MSPA configuration the gpp flag should be added (gpp: true) and ccpa object should contain 'includeGppApi' parameter set to 'true'. Instructions and additional MSPS settings can be found in [this Sourcepoint guide](https://docs.sourcepoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/18007731422099-Enable-GPP-Multi-State-Privacy-String-MSPS-with-U-S-Privacy-CCPA-solution). 
    <Prop name="accountId" type="number" required>

      your Sourcepoint account.
    </Prop>
    <Prop name="baseEndpoint" type="string">

      For GDPR TCF, CCPA, GDPR Standard, and Custom Messaging, the baseEndpoint is https://cdn.privacy-mgmt.com.
    </Prop>
    <Prop name="isSPA" type="boolean">
      When set to true, will confirm the implementation for a single page
      application and will show a message only when
      window._sp_.executeMessaging();is triggered.
      <br />
      <b>Note:</b> <InlineCode>window._sp_.executeMessaging();</InlineCode> is
      supposed to be called on each (virtual) pageload.

## How to run on localhost

The minimum parameters for the Consent component to run locally are a sourcePointConfig object with accountId and siteHref for TCFV1 and with an accountId and propertyHref for TCFV1.
The `siteHref` or `propertyHref` property should be an url that that exists in your account's property group. Contact your sourcepoint account manager.

In a V2 example it would look like this:

<Code>
  {`<Consent
    sourcePointConfigTCFV2={{
      accountId: accountId,
      propertyHref: 'http://newskit.co.uk/'
    }}
  />`}
</Code>

## Consent button

By setting `renderConsentButton` to false the default consent button will be hidden. This component can be use intead. It gives the flexibilty to place anywhere on the page.

<LegacyBlock marginTop="sizing040">
  <Prop name="settingsButtonText" type="string" default="Privacy Settings">
    Consent button label text
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="postPromptUI" type="string" default="privacy-settings-prompt">
    As this prop connects the consent button to the consent component, the value
    of this prop needs to match with the value provided in the consent
    component.
  </Prop>
</LegacyBlock>
