# Consent

## Overview

The consent component is a non-visual component for the consent of the use of 3rd party cookies. It triggers the loading of a Sourcepoint CMP (Content Management Platform) dialog to allow the user to decide what 3rd party cookies they wish to allow or disallow on their browser.
Unless you are utilising React Helmet, it must be placed inside the body of the document during server-side rendering. NewsKit has both an AMP and non-AMP version of this component. The two are not interchangeable so you must ensure you use the correct one.

At the moment this component is supporting two version of the Sourcepoint config. Versions GDPR TCF V2 and GDPR Non-TCF.

## Prerequisites

To utilise this component you will need to have a [Sourcepoint](https://www.sourcepoint.com) account and, if required, a Sourcepoint messaging subdomain set up. For more detailed information
please see Sourcepoint [documentation TCF V2](https://documentation.sourcepoint.com/web-implementation/web-implementation/sourcepoint-gdpr-and-tcf-v2-support/) or
[documentation Non-TCF](https://documentation.sourcepoint.com/web-implementation/web-implementation/gdpr-non-tcf-web-implementation).

      has been replaced by the new <InlineCode>baseEndpoint</InlineCode>{' '}
      parameter for optimization reasons. This change is completely backwards
      compatible. However, it is recommended that older implementations move to

      web browser (due to Safari’s ITP) by setting cookies through the server
      with "set-cookie" rather than using "document.cookie" on the page.
      Changing the baseEndpoint domain is optional but recommended!

      By default the Consent component will inject its scripts by rendering

## How to run on localhost

The minimum parameters for the Consent component to run locally are a sourcePointConfig object with accountId and siteHref for TCFV1 and with an accountId and propertyHref for TCFV1.
The `siteHref` or `propertyHref` property should be an url that that exists in your account's property group. Contact your sourcepoint account manager.

In a V2 example it would look like this:

<Code>
  {`<Consent
    sourcePointConfigTCFV2={{
      accountId: accountId,
      propertyHref: 'http://newskit.co.uk/'
    }}
  />`}
</Code>

## Consent button

By setting `renderConsentButton` to false the default consent button will be hidden. This component can be use intead. It gives the flexibilty to place anywhere on the page.

<LegacyBlock marginTop="sizing040">
  <Prop name="settingsButtonText" type="string" default="Privacy Settings">
    Consent button label text
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="postPromptUI" type="string" default="privacy-settings-prompt">
    As this prop connects the consent button to the consent component, the value
    of this prop needs to match with the value provided in the consent
    component.
  </Prop>
</LegacyBlock>
