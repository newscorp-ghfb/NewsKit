# Experimentation Web

## Overview

[Optimizely Web Experimentation](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/web/docs/introduction) is front-end A/B and multi-page experimentation product.
The Experimentation Web component is a non-visual component for the injection of the Optimizely Web 3rd party script and custom script for enabling Optimizely based on cookie.

## Prerequisites

To utilise this component you will need to have the relevant Optimizely Web project in the
[Optimizely platform](https://app.optimizely.com/)
and Optimizely script CDN URL.

## Usage

<CodeFromFile path="examples/experimentation-web.tsx" />

The component should be added at the top-level of the project in the `<head>` tag. The Optimizely script should run before the other scripts to avoid flickering and unexpected DOM changes on the page.

Itâ€™s important to load the Optimizely script before the utag script, so that the GA `page-view` event can report on the running experiments.

## Props

<LegacyBlock marginTop="sizing040">
  <Prop name="optimizelyWebConfig" type="object" required>
    The config object that initialises Optimizely Web. Required parameters:{' '}
    <b>scriptCdn</b>.
    <Prop required name="scriptCdn" type="string" required>
      Optimizely script CDN URL.
      The URL can be found in <i>Settings {'->'} Implementation</i> for every web project in the Optimizely platform.
      More information on how to retrieve the script can be found{' '}
      <a href="https://documentation.sourcepoint.com/web-implementation/sourcepoint-set-up-and-configuration-v2">
        here
      </a>{' '}.
    </Prop>
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="reactHelmet" type="React.ComponentType<{script?: Array<any>}>">
    By default the Experimentation Web component will inject its scripts by rendering script
    tags. However, if your project is using{' '}
    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet" target="_blank">
      React Helmet
    </a>{' '}
    you can pass the Helmet component in and the scripts will render
    using that component.
  </Prop>

  <Prop name="async" type="boolean">
    If you are looking for better page-load performance, you might consider loading Optimizely as a non-blocking resource (async).
    However, this sometimes causes page flickering, which in turn can generate sub-optimal user experiences.
    We strongly recommend to load the Optimizely snippet as non-blocking.
    By default the component loads Optimizely synchronously.
