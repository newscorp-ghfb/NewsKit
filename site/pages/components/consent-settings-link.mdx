# Consent Settings Link

## Overview

The consent settings link is a component utilising the <a href='/components/link'>Link</a> component which on click will open the Sourcepoint CMP (Content Management Platform) privacy manager. This allows users to review or edit their privacy settings after they have submitted the initial privacy consent message.

## Prerequisites

To utilise this component you will need to have added the <a href='/components/consent'>Consent</a> component added to the head of the page. You will also need to obtain your site id and privacy manager id from Sourcepoint, these are different from the account id used with the [Consent](components/consent) component.

## Usage

<CodeFromFile path="examples/consent-settings-link.tsx"/>

## Props

The consent settings link supports any prop valid on the <a href='/components/link'>Link</a> component. If click event is passed to this component, it can handle it along with the opening of the Sourcepoint CMP privacy manager.

Custom and required props are detailed below:

<LegacyBlock marginTop="sizing040">
  <Prop required name="privacyManagerId" type="string">
    Your privacy manager id.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="siteId" type="string">
    Your Sourcepoint site id. This is used for the legacy TCFv1 sourcepoint script.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The legacy TCFv2 script only needs privacy manager id.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="gdpr" type="boolean">
    If you're using the unified Sourcepoint script for GDPR.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="ccpa" type="boolean">
    If you're using the unified Sourcepoint script for CCPA.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="tabToOpen" type="'purposes' | 'vendors' | 'features' | 'purposes-li' | 'vendors-li'">
    If you're using the unified Sourcepoint script for GDPR, you can choose the opening view of the modal.
  </Prop>
  <Prop name="children" type="ReactNode" default="Manage Consent">
    The content of the link. Can be undefined and left to default text.
  </Prop>
</LegacyBlock>
