# Grid & Cell

## Overview

### Usage

The Grid and Cell components are used together to construct a visual grid for responsive page layout. The Grid containers children must be Cell components, which can span different widths at each of the 5 breakpoints.

The 5 breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg, xl) widths are set via the theme, as are the grid settings. The NewsKit light default grid settings are as follows (set in `componentDefaults`):

| Setting         | Default Value      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| maxWidth        | 1920px             | The maximum width of the Grid container component. The Grid will not grow bigger than 1920px wide.                                                                                                              |
| containerMargin | space040, space050 | The margin either side of the Grid container component. The margin can be different for each breakpoint. By default it is space040 for xs, sm & md, and space050 for lg & xl.                                   |
| columnGutters   | space040, space050 | The spacing between each Cell component column (i.e. left and right). The margin can be different for each breakpoint. By default it is space040 for xs, sm & md, and space050 for lg & xl.                     |
| rowGutters      | space040, space050 | The spacing between each Cell component row (i.e. top and bottom when Cells are wrapped). The margin can be different for each breakpoint. By default it is space040 for xs, sm & md, and space050 for lg & xl. |
| columns         | 12                 | The total columns available to use. Each Cell by default takes up 1 column. If there are more Cells in a Grid than columns, or the Cell components inside a Grid span a total greater than 12, they will wrap.  |

## Grid Props
