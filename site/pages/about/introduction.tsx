            Design systems have become the gold standard for product
            development. Some benefits include:
          </ContentText>
          <ContentText title="Speed to market">
            Upfront research, design and development allows teams to build new
            features or products quickly and with confidence. Rapid creation
            translates to the increased pace of innovation.
          </ContentText>
          <ContentText title="Shared knowledge">
            NewsKit is built through collaboration and is available to all.
            Feedback from a diverse range of consumers produces a more robust,
            considered and flexible product. In addition, NewsKit allows teams
            to benefit from the research and experience of other teams and solve
            problems once.
          </ContentText>
          <ContentText title="Best Practice">
            All NewsKit components support keyboard navigation, screen readers
            and touch screens, conforming to{' '}
            <Link href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank">
              W3C&apos;s WCAG 2.1 guidelines
            </Link>{' '}
            for accessibility. In addition, the components take in SEO
            considerations where relevant and are rigorously tested. Finally,
            detailed guidance documentation ensures clarity.
          </ContentText>
          <ContentText title="Sustainability">
            NewsKit allows teams to do more with less; components are maintained
            centrally, enabling teams to achieve incremental upgrades and manage
            their digital product needs as they grow.
          </ContentText>
          <ContentText title="Flexibility">
            The powerful theming system allows styling to be tailored to the
            needs of any brand. Themes can be applied globally or per component,
            enabling visual differences between sections, sub-brands or
            unlocking user preferences like dark mode or page density settings.
            In addition, all components are designed to ensure they can be
            applied to multiple use cases.
          </ContentText>
          <ContentText title="Consistency">
            NewsKit establishes a common language between designer and engineer
            and applies a systematic approach to all aspects of the interface.
            Infinitely reusable components and clear guidance around design and
            engineering best practices enable teams to build consistency across
            products and teams.
