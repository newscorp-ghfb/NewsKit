# Using Themes

## Overview

To render NewsKit components you must have a theme available for them to utilise. You can use your own theme, or use one of the two NewsKit defaults - NewsKit light and NewsKit dark. Details on how to create your theme can be found [here](/theme/theming/creating-a-theme).

## Setting a theme

### NewskitProvider & ThemeProvider components

NewskitProvider provides a single wrapper to configure your application. It adds a ThemeProvider to handle styling.


A ThemeProvider utilises a React Context to provide a theme to all NewsKit components descended under it. You pass your theme (or a NewsKit default) to the `theme` prop. This will typically be an uncompiled theme, but you can pass a pre-compiled theme if you wish.

<CodeFromFile path="examples/theming/theme-provider.tsx" />

The theme provided is then available to any NewsKit component under it. The theme is also used by any custom styled components created using the `styled` function exported from NewsKit.

<CodeFromFile path="examples/theming/styled.tsx" />

ThemeProvider's can also be nested - allowing the child to override the parent theme. This will only cause a shallow merge of the child theme over the parent. To create a sub-theme which inherits from a base theme, see the `createTheme` documentation [here](/theme/theming/creating-a-theme).

<InlineMessage overri>ThemeProvider can be nested, however, we do NOT recommend nesting NewskitProviders, as it can lead to unexpected behaviour. NewskitProvider should only be used once per application on a very top level.
</InlineMessage>

## Reading a theme

As the example shows above, reading from a theme inside a styled component works as you would expect from Emotion. However, if you wish to read from the theme outside of a styled component, you have two options - a higher-order component and a React hook.

## withTheme higher-order component

By wrapping your component in `withTheme`, the theme object will be passed into your component as a prop.

<CodeFromFile path="examples/theming/with-theme.tsx" />

### useTheme hook

The `useTheme` hook also allows you to access the theme, but helps avoid the extra "wrapper hell" that higher-order components bring.
