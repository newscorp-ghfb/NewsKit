# Scripts

A list of project script commands included in the package.json.

## Naming Convention

Scripts should be named using the following naming convention:
[action]:[context]

## Dev

* `dev` -> runs in parallel the main Typescript project, storybook, and documentation sites in watch mode.

* `dev:docs` -> runs in parallel the main Typescript project and documentation sites in watch mode.

## Linting

* `lint:code` -> runs linter (eslint) for all the files across the src, site, e2e e.t.c.

* `lint:code:fix` -> runs the linter as above but with --fix (autofix) flag.

* `lint:code:base` -> runs eslint without specifying file or folders, used by lint:code and githooks, you probably don't need to use this.

* `lint:markdown` -> runs linter for all the .md files in the packages.

* `lint` -> runs all lint:<> scripts.

## Testing

* `test` -> runs lint and test:unit:dev scripts, ignores ci-only tests.

* `test:unit:run` -> used by other commands to call jest with correct base arguments. Use to generate snapshots for ci-only tests.

* `test:unit:ci` -> runs all the unit tests with CircleCI optimised config.

* `test:unit:comps` -> runs the unit tests on the src folder.

* `test:unit:site` -> runs the unit tests on the site folder.

* `test:visual:comps:ci:percy` -> starts the local storybook and runs the percy storybook tests afterwards.

* `e2e:build` -> builds the end to end tests.

* `e2e:serve` -> runs the end to end tests on port 8080.

* `e2e:comps` -> opens the cypress test runner in interactive mode and loads the tests found on cypress/components folder (e2e:serve needs to be running prior to this).

* `e2e:comps:ci` -> starts e2e:serve and runs the cypress components tests headlessly.

* `e2e:docs` -> opens the cypress test runner and loads the tests found on cypress/site folder.

* `e2e:docs:ci` -> starts serve:docs and runs the cypress docs tests headlessly.

Run Percy from main branch if you want to force the baseline images to be updated. The two commands to yarn run, after you have switched to main branch and done a git pull, are shown below:

* `test:visual:comps:local:percy` -> sets required env variables and runs the percy component tests locally.

* `e2e:visual:docs:local:percy` -> sets required env variables and runs the percy doc site tests locally.

Image updating normally happens whenever a PR is merged to main, but occasionally it can get out of sync. NB Do *not* set PERCY_PARTIAL_BUILD=1 on main branch, as that is not supported (only on feature branches). We use it on the pull_request workflow to bypass a full visual regression (just one dummy test is run).

Percy support issues can be raised by emailing support@browserstack.com.

## Storybook

* `dev:storybook` -> locally starts storybook at port 6006.

## Build and deploy

* `build:clean` -> removes any existing build.

* `build:copy-files` -> copies over README to components dist folder.

* `build:package-json` -> builds a package json for component library dist, adding module definitions.

* `build:ts` -> builds the Typescript components using es2015 module format, into dist/.

* `build:ts:cjs` -> builds the Typescript components using commonJs module format, into dist/common/.

* `build:storybook` -> builds storybook.

* `build:docs` -> builds documentation site, into public/.

* `postbuild:docs` -> move 404.html to public/.

* `build:icons` -> generates only the icons that are used within newskit.

* `build:comps` -> builds the components folder ready to be published to NPM.

* `build:sync-version-number` -> copies the current version number from package json into the src folder.

* `build` -> runs the above builds, creating a ready to publish dist folder, as well as storybook and docs.

* `serve:docs` -> starts a simple http server to serve the documentation site in public/.

* `serve:storybook` -> serves the storybook as static files.

## Utils

* `preinstall` -> stops npm being used for install, please use yarn instead.

* `dependencies:check` -> runs the package-change-checker module, this runs `yarn install` if dependencies or dev dependencies have changed between `HEAD@{1}` and `HEAD`. Used via husky post-checkout and post-merge hooks.
