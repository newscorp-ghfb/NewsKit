# Testing

## Running lint and unit tests locally

To run all the linting and unit tests, run `yarn test`

You can pass the `--watch` parameter to continuously run the relevant tests.

## Running the Cypress component tests locally

It is your responsibility to also add Cypress functional tests and visual tests when writing a new component or making changes to existing components.

To ensure that we have accessibility automated tests coverage, when creating a new component, there should be a test for checking that it passes basic accessibility checks. This can be done by calling the following Cypress commands:

```javascript
cy.injectAxe();
cy.checkA11y();
```

Any accessibility violations will be reported on the Cypress test runner.

To run component tests:

* `yarn e2e:build; yarn e2e:serve` (wait for it to start serving)
* (in a separate terminal) `yarn e2e:comps`

To run docs tests:

* `yarn build:docs`
* `yarn serve:docs` (wait for it to start serving)
* (in a separate terminal) `yarn e2e:docs`
